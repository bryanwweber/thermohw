## Instructions

You have 1.25 hours to complete the exam. When you are finished with the exam, you should download
a PDF of all of your Notebooks and upload it to Gradescope. You **_MUST_** upload the exam to
Gradescope before the end of your course period or **_IT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED_**. Absolutely no
late exams will be accepted, no excuses, no BS. If you have any problems, contact me as soon as you
run into trouble.

Complete all of the questions below. Short answer questions should be answered in the indicated
Markdown cell immediately below the question statement, and can generally be answered in 1-3
sentences. The answers to problem solving questions should be placed in the indicated Markdown
cells, which should be immediately below your work on that problem.

You may use your computer, calculator, textbook, homework problem solutions, JupyterHub/ThermoState,
or any websites to solve the problems. However, you may not copy the question text (or portions of
the text) into a search engine, and **you must work by yourself** to solve these problems.
Furthermore, my standard policy on academic integrity from the course syllabus applies (in addition
to the statement below)â€”All of the work that you hand in must be entirely your own; as one example,
you may not use answers to these questions that you find on the web directly, your answers must
represent your own work and your own understanding.

---

## Honesty and Academic Integrity Statement

**Read the following statement and type your name in the cell below to indicate your acceptance
of and agreement with these policies**

I agree that I will not discuss, disclose, copy, reproduce, adapt, or transmit exam content orally,
in writing, on the Internet, or through any other medium prior to the distribution of the exam
solutions by the Instructor. I agree that I will (and have) worked entirely on my own for this exam
and the work below represents entirely my individual work and understanding. I understand that my
failure to follow the above guidelines will result in the consequences outlined in the syllabus
under the academic honesty and integrity policy, possibly including, but not limited to, a failing
grade on this exam.

    This preprocessor produces output suitable for distribution to students as

    which delimits the beginning of the solution section. Then, for every cell
    after that, it checks for a level 3 header, which delimits the start of a
    section of the solution. All cells between the level 3 headers are replaced
